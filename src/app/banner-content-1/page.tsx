            exclusive to the Southern Western Ghats, and receive the{" "}
            <strong>highest level of legal protection under Schedule-I</strong>{" "}
            of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972. Culturally and ecologically
            significant, Nilgiri Tahrs are even referred in the{" "}

            These mammals are social by nature, typically forming herds
            consisting of adult females, their young, and occasionally males â€“
            especially during the mating (rutting) season. Outside of this
            period, males often form separate bachelor groups or lead solitary
            lives, while females tend to stay in cohesive groups.
